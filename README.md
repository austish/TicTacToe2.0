Java project that evoles the game of Tic-Tac-Toe.

Tic-Tac-Toe 2.0 allows for 3 to 10 players and the size of the board depends on the amount of players. More specifically, it will be player count + 1 x player count + 1. The final twist is that the user can choose how many pieces are needed for a win. The mininum amount of pieces is 3 and the maximum is player count + 1.
